## What is an Art Bible?

The Art Bible is the document that defines the artistic style of a videogame and sets the boundaries for that style, this document is created by the Art Directors before going into the production of the art, it is done just after the GDD when the mechanics are done. The art bible is the guide for the people who work on the project.
