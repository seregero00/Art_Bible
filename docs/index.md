## What is an Art Bible?

The Art Bible is the document that defines the artistic style of a videogame and sets the boundaries for that style, this document is created by the Art Directors before going into the production of the art, it is done just after the GDD when the mechanics are done. The art bible is the guide for the people who work on the project.

## Main Usage

Within a project, art bibles have two main functions:
- Memory Aid
  - Reference to consult for details about the project
  - Maintain consistency through all the production process
  - Keep cohesion between all the members
- Communication
  - Tell about how the game will look like (and the reasons behind it)
  - Help the art department understand the art direction
  - Allow new members to be up to date with the team
  - **Marketing!** (Always have something to show)

**1. - Art Style**
This is crucial for the understanding of the most important feelings of the game that the players should have while playing it and what the main direction of the project will be focused on. It will define the artistic focus of the game, which should be consistent across all elements. This may include:
- Graphic style:
  - 2D/2.5D/3D
  - Realistic
  - Stylized
  - Cartoon
  - PixelArt
- Main Camera
- Time Period
- Atmosphere (Weather,Day,Night)
- Shapes
- General Color Palettes
- Materials & Textures
- References

The decisions made at this stage will determine the final look of the game, so it's a critical time to make important decisions about the art of the game.

**2. - Character Art**

This part of the art bible must contain everything related to the character, if there are different characters, this part must contain all of them, clearly organised.If there are enemies, divide them by zones. Each character should contain:
- Sketches
- Character Poses
- Expressions of the character
- Colour palette
- Geight scale comparison
- Clothing
- Style
- Animations

**3. - Level of detail(LOD)**

This section of the Art Bible is very important because it sets the standard for the level of detail required in the game. It covers the differences in the level of detail required for the narrative, gameplay and user interface elements. It also outlines techniques for increasing and decreasing detail during the drawing process, as well as which specific elements must be detailed and which can be left at a lower level of detail.

**4. - Camera**
