## What is an Art Bible?

The Art Bible is the document that defines the artistic style of a videogame and sets the boundaries for that style, this document is created by the Art Directors before going into the production of the art, it is done just after the GDD when the mechanics are done. The art bible is the guide for the people who work on the project.

## Main Usage

The Art Bible functions are:
- Communication
  - Tell about how the game will look like (and the reasons behind it)
  - Help the art department understand the art direction
  - Allow new members to be up to date with the team
  - **Marketing!** (Always have something to show)
- Memory Aid
  - Reference to consult for details about the project
  - Maintain consistency through all the production process
  - Keep cohesion between all the members
