# Art Bible
I am [Sergio Corona Gómez](https://github.com/seregero00), student of Videogame Design and Development in CITM of UPC.
This page was generated for the Project II subject,under supervision of lecturer [Pedro Omedas](https://github.com/pomedas). This page tries to explain how to create an Art Bible.
#### Personal Recommendation: If you want to get a closer look at everything, it is recommended to zoom in to 125 %

## What is an Art Bible?

The Art Bible is the document that defines the artistic style of a videogame and sets the boundaries for that style, this document is created by the Art Directors before going into the production of the art, it is done just after the GDD when the mechanics are done. The art bible is the guide for the people who work on the project.

## Main Usage

Within a project, art bibles have two main functions:
- Memory Aid
  - Reference to consult for details about the project
  - Maintain consistency through all the production process
  - Keep cohesion between all the members
- Communication
  - Tell about how the game will look like (and the reasons behind it)
  - Help the art department understand the art direction
  - Allow new members to be up to date with the team
  - **Marketing!** (Always have something to show)

## Content of an Art Bible

     - 6. Environment/atmosphere
     - 7. Texture & Surface
     - 8. User interface

**1. - Art Style**
This is crucial for the understanding of the most important feelings of the game that the players should have while playing it and what the main direction of the project will be focused on. It will define the artistic focus of the game, which should be consistent across all elements. This may include:
- Graphic style:
  - 2D/2.5D/3D
  - Realistic
  - Stylized
  - Cartoon
  - PixelArt
- Main Camera
- Time Period
- Atmosphere (Weather,Day,Night)
- Shapes
- General Color Palettes
- Materials & Textures
- References

The decisions made at this stage will determine the final look of the game, so it's a critical time to make important decisions about the art of the game.

**2. - Character Art**

This part of the art bible must contain everything related to the character, if there are different characters, this part must contain all of them, clearly organised.If there are enemies, divide them by zones. Each character should contain:
- Sketches
- Character Poses
- Expressions of the character
- Colour palette
- Height scale comparison
- Clothing
- Style
- Animations

**3. - Level of detail(LOD)**

This section of the Art Bible is very important because it sets the standard for the level of detail required in the game. It covers the differences in the level of detail required for the narrative, gameplay and user interface elements. It also outlines techniques for increasing and decreasing detail during the drawing process, as well as which specific elements must be detailed and which can be left at a lower level of detail.

**4. - Camera**

In this section it is necessary to decide what kind of cameras are going to be used in the different parts of the game, in particular in the 3D games. The aspects to be defined are:
- Camera effects
- Fields of view (Covers all scenarios)
- Transitions

![graph5](https://github.com/seregero00/Art_Bible/blob/main/docs/images/graph5.png?raw=true)

**5. - Colour palette**

This is where we decide which colour choices are appropriate for distinguishing scenes, objects and characters. The points to consider are:
- Saturation
- Tones
- Hues

It is important to explain why the choice of this saturation, hues, etc...

![graph7](https://github.com/seregero00/Art_Bible/blob/main/docs/images/graph7.png?raw=true)

**6. - Environment/Atmosphere**

This is where you define the places the player will go through, such as dungeons, the lobby. The idea is to conceptualise what each location will look like and how it should make the player feel, adding references.

![graph6](https://github.com/seregero00/Art_Bible/blob/main/docs/images/graph6.jpg?raw=true)

**7. - Texture & Surface**

This aspect is closely related to the colour treatment and involves specifying the desired texture type and level of detail. This section is used to guide artists on how to create props and ensure that they are consistent with the art style.

![graph9](https://github.com/seregero00/Art_Bible/blob/main/docs/images/graph9.jpg?raw=true)

**8. - User interface**

It is important to define a style within the user interface. In this section, you will decide on a common style and decide on the following issues:
- Fonts
- Menus
- In-game UI
- Descriptions
- Dialogue Boxes

It is highly recommended to wireframe each interface that the player will interact with.


![graph1](https://github.com/seregero00/Art_Bible/blob/main/docs/images/graph1.png?raw=true)

**9. - Technical Guidelines**

This is where we will define the specifications related to:
- Exporting formats
- Image sizes
- Limitations
- Naming Conventions
- Tool Used
- File structure inside the project

![graph2](https://github.com/seregero00/Art_Bible/blob/main/docs/images/graph2.png?raw=true)

Often this part is overlooked, but it is very important that the art director checks that this is done in order to optimise the work.

# General Advices

- Art Style: Try to choose a style in which you feel comfortable and which is possible for you to do according to your limits.

- Avoid large blocks of text. Use images
